    "prompt": "A candid, documentary-style medium shot of a happy millennial woman organizing gifts at a cozy kitchen table, warm golden hour sunlight streaming through a window. She smiles gently as she arranges neatly wrapped presents and handwritten cards, surrounded by subtle hints of celebration like a ribbon spool and a mug of tea. The environment feels lived-in and welcoming, with soft orange and peach undertones in the lighting. The composition uses a slightly off-center framing, with gentle foreground blur from a gift bag handle, and background hints of birthday candles on a side shelf. The overall mood is one of calm excitement and authentic anticipation, capturing the joy of preparing gifts in a relaxed, personal space.",
